/// A bottom type that represents a missing type.

/// As a theoretical bottom type, this type could be used anywhere a type is expected.

/// The type is named as such to make finding occurrences of it through codebases easier.
public enum TODO {
	
	/// Asserts that a function (or part thereof) is unimplemented.
	///
	/// Use of this value silences the compiler's definite initialisation analyser and causes a fatal error at runtime. For example, this does not produce a build-time error:

	///		func doingSomething() -> Something {

	///		}
	public static var unimplemented: Never {
